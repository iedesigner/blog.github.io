Wow, I'm very happy to be using Jekyll for my blog.

Writing in Markdown looks interesting. 

Much better than when I tried to make my own blog from scratch.

Very happy that there's also support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('iedesigner')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I will definitely be checking out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. I will remember to ile all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If I have questions, I will ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
